The original idea was born in a ugly day meanwhile I was writing my Ph.D. thesis. Thinking a new evolution starting from my latest robot [Dude](https://rnext.it/robot/dude/). The idea of this new robot was completely different from all other robots, making something able to explore outdoor environments and don't use wheels, but travelling with tracks.

# First sketch

Yes, there is another sketch direct on CAD, but the tracks used for this design was not enough for a outdoor and this CAD was quickly abandoned

{% include gallery id="first-cad" caption="Sketch first idea" layout="half" %}

# Panther sketch

The first real sketch was a robot looks like a Jeep with track. 

{% include gallery id="sketch-first" caption="Sketch first idea" %}

the shape was not enough and I start to rounding and shaping making a look more futuristic and similar a race car.

{% include gallery id="sketch-second" caption="Panther final look" %}
# Panther 3D CAD

From sketch to a real 3D model, the step is huge and many tests I made many experiments to be possible realize a real track using in particular plexiglass and not aluminum like all robots with a track and size like Panther. 

{% include gallery id="panther-cad-first" caption="Panther first 3D cad design" %}

The new shape was significantly better compare the first version, and after long work I start to obtain the look drawn on my sketch

{% include gallery id="panther-cad" %}

## Track design

The first idea of the Panther tracks was born looking this weird segway found online. The tracks profile was amazing and my idea was to re-engineering using different materials, components and payload.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/design/00-panther-idea.jpg" alt="Track idea" caption="Track idea" %}

This work was really hard with my knowledge really poor in mechanics. I am a control theory engineer, and my background is different compare a mechanical engineer, but armed of willpower I start step by step to design on cad the track.

{% include gallery id="track-first" caption="track design" %}

Meanwhile I was working on my CAD the first components was coming, in particular the track, really huge compare the other track I have seen from commercial robots. This track was the reference to complete the second design step and moving forward to complete all parts.

Same story for the damper, made for RC cars, but perfect for the robot! Simple and nice, the only issue was the spring, to weak to support the payload from the robot.

{% include gallery id="track-parts" caption="Panther dumper" %}

Finally after a long work, the real track was appearing on my CAD, and with all components available and with a dimension compatible with the size of the robot!

{% include gallery id="track-panther" caption="track design" %}

Thi is the final cad of the Panther track

## Upgrades on Panther

In this picture the last update on Panther, adding a lidar and reshaping the robot with new motors
