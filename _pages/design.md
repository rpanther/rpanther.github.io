The original idea was born in a ugly day meanwhile I was writing my Ph.D. thesis. Thinking a new evolution starting from my latest robot [Dude](https://rnext.it/robot/dude/). The idea of this new robot was completely different from all other robots, making something able to explore outdoor environments and don't use wheels, but travelling with tracks.

# First sketch

Yes, there is another sketch direct on CAD, but the tracks used for this design was not enough for a outdoor and this CAD was quickly abandoned

# Panther sketch

The first real sketch was a robot looks like a Jeep with track.

the shape was not enough and I start to rounding and shaping making a look more futuristic and similar a race car.

# Panther 3D CAD

From sketch to a real 3D model, the step is huge and many tests I made many experiments to be possible realize a real track using in particular plexiglass and not aluminum like all robots with a track and size like Panther.
